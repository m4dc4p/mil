\chapter{The Hoopl Library}

\emph{Introduce the Hoopl library, describing how
it approaches dataflow analysis. Important concepts
such as shape, transfer and rewrite functions, facts and
lattices will be described. }

\chapter{Uncurrying}

\chapter{Monadic Optimizations}
\emph{Describes optimizations based on the monad laws: bind/return collapse and
  monadic fuzzbang (inlining)}

\section{Copy-propagation}
\emph{Collapsing ``|x <- return y; p|'' to ``|[y/x] p|''.}
\subsection{Example of Desired Optimization}
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsection{Reflection}

\section{Inlining}
\emph{Monadic inlining using the associativity law. That is:}

> y <- (z <- x; p1)
> p2

\noindent
\emph{becomes:}

> z <- x
> y <- p1
> p2

\subsection{Implementation}
\subsection{Reflection}

\chapter{Uncurrying}
\label{ref_chapter_uncurrying}
\emph{Describes our optimization for collapsing intermediate
closures. Our choice of representation is analyzed to
show how it facilitates this optimization. We should show one
closure can be eliminated from a program and how the optimization
is applied over and over until a fixed point is reached. The format
for this section will vary from the other two.}

\chapter{Lazy Code Motion}
\emph{Describes our implementation of LCM in terms of the four passes
  used. This section will give an overview of LCM and briefly describe
  each pass. We give a example program which will be used throughout
  the section.}

\section{Anticipated Expressions}

\section{Available Expressions}

\section{Dead-code Elimination}

\section{Reflection}

\emph{Conclusions regarding our implemenation.}

\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Work}

\emph{Where we started and where we wished we could have go to.}
