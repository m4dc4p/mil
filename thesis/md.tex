%% This stuff makes !+<text>+! write <text> in typewriter font.  

%% We make ! and + active characters early, then manipulate their
%% meaning to produce the right effect. Initially, + produces +. When
%% !  appears w/o a + following, it produces ``!''. When ``+''
%% follows, we start writing in teleteype (\ttfamily). The definition
%% of ``!'' changes to produce a bang. ``+'' changes such that it
%% looks for trailing ``!''. When no ``!'' appears, ``+'' produces ``+''. 
%% If a ``!'' appears, we shift out of \ttfamily (by ending the group) and
%% reset the meaning of ``!'' and ``+'' so we can start again.
