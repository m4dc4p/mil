\section*{Abstract}
The \emph{dataflow algorithm}, which analyzes programs using
their \emph{control-flow graph}, underlies many optimizations
implemented in modern compilers for imperative languages. Functional
language compilers, in contrast, traditionally optimize by rewriting
programs according to algebraic laws. By compiling functional programs
to a \emph{monadic intermediate language} (\mil), we can describe
traditional functional language optimizations using \emph{dataflow
equations}, the parameters that drive dataflow algorithm. Our work
gives an overview of dataflow analysis and describes how to
use \hoopl, a Haskell library implementing the dataflow algorithm. We introduce
\mil, an intermediate language designed for monadic programming, 
implementation of high-level functional language features, and
dataflow analysis. This work gives a novel description of
the \emph{uncurrying} optimization in terms of dataflow equations. We
also discuss how \mil programs can be optimized using the \emph{monad
laws} (independent of the dataflow algorithm), and a way in which
dataflow analysis could eliminate unnecessary allocations in the
presence of conditional expressions.
