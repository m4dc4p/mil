Our work applies the \emph{dataflow algorithm} to an area outside its
traditional scope: functional languages. Our approach relies on
a \emph{monadic intermediate language} that provides low-level,
imperative features like computed jumps and explicit allocations,
while at the same time supporting high-level, functional-language
features like case discrimination and partial application. We
prototyped our work in Haskell using the \hoopl library and this
dissertation shows numerous examples demonstrating its use. We prove
the efficacy of our approach by giving a novel description of
the \emph{uncurrying} optimization in terms of the dataflow algorithm, as
well as a complete implementation of the optimization using \hoopl.\par}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
I wish to give my heartfelt thanks to my very patient and very understanding
wife, Erin. She provided invaluable support throughout a long, long
project. I also owe a great debt to my advisor, Dr. Mark P. Jones, who
foolishly decided to teach me how functional language compilers
worked. His ideas, enthusiasm, and willingness to mentor me made this
project both challenging and highly rewarding. 

I also wish to thank my managers at \textsc{adp} who gave me the time
and freedom to pursue school: Mark Rankin, Tom Douglass, and Kathy
Oullette. Without their support, I would simply have not been able to
afford the time to return to school.

Finally, my thanks to the faculty and staff in the Computer Science
department at Portland State University. I feel blessed that a 
place full of such smart, interesting and friendly people was just
a little ways away from my home and work.
