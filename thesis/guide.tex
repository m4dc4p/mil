\section{Thesis Style Guide}

This document specifies the typographic guidelines followed for various
elements in the thesis. 

\section*{Abbreviations}
Abbreviations such as \mil and \cfg appear in small caps. When an
acronym starts a sentence, its first letter is capitalized (e.g.,
``\Mil'').

New terms are written in italic type when they are first
introduced. For example, ``The \emph{dataflow algorithm} defines a
general approach to program analysis\dots''. Abbreviations
are introduced by writing them after the term: ``A \emph{control-flow graph}
(\cfg) \dots''

\section*{Numbers}
Chapter, Section, Page and Figure references use old-style numerals:
0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  Line numbers are also old-style.

Superscripts, subscripts, and footnotes use ``normal'' numerals: $0,
1, 2, 3,$ etc.  Numbers in mathematical expressions are normal (e.g.,
``$x = 10$, '' not ``$x = $\ 10'').  Indexed variables (e.g., $B_1$,
$t_1$, etc.) also use normal numerals.

\section*{Syntax}
\Mil program fragments appear in typewriter font: \binds x <- \goto readChar();,
\lab main/, \block print(x):, etc. \lamC program fragments use italic
font: \lcdef compose (f,g,x)=\lcapp f * (g * x)/;.
