\textbf{Question:} Can we compile the #prioset# example such that it uses no heap memory for data structures or closures?

\bigskip

I will explore efficient compilation techniques for Habit programs. My
research will focus on minimizing or eliminating the allocation of two
types of data: algebraic data types and function closures. The #prioset#
example from the Habit language report will motivate my research. 

A successful project will show that the program can be compiled such
that no heap memory gets allocated --- all data will be stored in
registers or on the stack. The code will not require special
annotations; that is, the optimizations implemented will be general
purpose. Other motivating examples will need to be found to validate
that the optimizations are truly general.
