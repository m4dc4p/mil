\chapter{Dead-code elimination}

%% \emph{The bulk of our work. Each optimization implemented is
%%   described. Each subsection should follow a common recipe: describe
%%   the optimization, give an example program and show how we want it
%%   changed, show salient points about the optimization (with code
%%   snippets and references to the full library), and reflect on the
%%   implementation.  Lazy Code Motion may get its own section.}

%% \emph{One question: should optimizations be categorized by direction? We could
%% describe all forward optimizations, then all backward ones. That may help
%% set up the concepts necessary to describe LCM.}

\emph{This portion gives an overview of the optimization, without
code or (much) notation. We motivate the optimization by 
showing an example.}

\section{Implementation}
\emph{``Interesting'' pieces of the implementation are described.}

\section{Reflection}
\emph{What was good, what didn't work so well, and how Hoopl helped
or hindered the implementation}
