\chapter{Languages}

\emph{Defines the languages used in the thesis and a simple
  compilation scheme from a \lamA variant to our monadic language. }

\section{Source Language}

\emph{Defines a \lamA variant with some monadic effects, enough to
  illustrate interesting programs.}

\section{Monadic Intermediate Language}

\emph{Defines our monadic language and explains the terms in
  it. Example programs are given which illustrate closure construction
  and data allocation. The use of ``tail'' vs. statements is motivated
  and described. }

\emph{Need to talk about the monad we work in as well - what 
do bind and return mean?}

\section{Compiling to Our MIL}
\emph{A compilation scheme which uses Hoopls ``shapes'' is
described. This scheme will give use our initial, unoptimized
MIL program. An example (possibly |compose|, or |const3|) illustrates 
our scheme.}
